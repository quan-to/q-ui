```jsx 
  <p>
    <Button>Regular</Button>
  </p>
  <p>
    <Button disable>Disabled</Button>
  </p>
  <p>
    <Button fluid>Fluid</Button>
  </p>
  <p>
    <Button fluid icon="arrow-right">Fluid with icon</Button>
  </p>
```

### Notes

- If your button's `disable` prop is `true`, `onClick` function will not be triggered.

- Describe your button's `icon` with the name of the image inside the image folder you've described during the themes setting up.
